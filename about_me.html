            <h1>Who is Asiah Crutchfield?</h1>
            <p>
                There are few questions in this world that are harder to answer than, 
                "Who am I?". It would seem being in your own company 24/7 and 
                reading your own thoughts should make it trivially easy to answer but 
                there are so many experiences that make us who we are, it becomes a 
                challenge to pick a handful of things that define who "I" even is.
                But I'm sure you're not here to read philosophical musings about 
                what the ego.

                Hi, my name is Asiah Crutchfield, also known as 孫塞亞. I'm 
                currently studying for a CS degree in Taiwan with the  
                goal of being able to have a career in the semiconductor industry
                or working with AI. It's a challenge to be sure but I'm not afraid 
                of being uncomfortable and taking calculated risks to reach a goal 
                or get something that I think will benefit me and those I care about.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I'm not holed away in a library studying, I like to lift weights,
                go for walks and bike rides, study Mandarin Chinese, and look for
                cheap, delicious and (preferably) healthy food. I try to keep my mind 
                open to all the interesting things the world has to offer. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I feel like a new chapter in my life has just opened and I can't
                wait to see what will happen next!
